# Crop-Weed-Classification-and-Removal-of-Weed

This GitHub repository contains all the code, models, and methodologies used in the hardware implementation of a deep learning-based crop weed classification system. The project aims to develop an accurate weed classification system using the YOLOv3 object detection model on a Raspberry Pi 4 platform. The repository explores how weeds affect agricultural productivity and the importance of targeted weed control. It provides insight into the factors affecting weed suppression and crop productivity and underscores the need for effective weed management methods.
This is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the application of deep learning techniques in agriculture and weed management.
